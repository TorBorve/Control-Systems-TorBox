# Control Systems Torbox

Control Systems Torbox is a rust library for performing analysis, simulation and implementation of linear control systems.


## Features

- [X] Transfer functions
- [ ] State Space
- [ ] General Linear Time Invariant systems. (delays in feedback)
- [ ] Connecting and feedback of LTI systems.
- [ ] poles and zeros of LTI systems
- [X] Bodeplot
- [X] Nyquistplot
- [ ] pole zero plot
- [ ] Pade approximation
- [ ] c2d and d2c
- [ ] Simulate systems

## Todo

- [x] Display TF, RF, Polynomial
- [x] 2.0*Tf, ...
- [x] Improve plotting structure. Make plotting trait which nyquistplot and bodeplot implements?
- [X] Impl egui for bode- and nyquist-plot.
- [x] Fix x_limits and y_limits egui use auto scale if not set.
- [x] Sych x-limits in Bodeplot
- [x] Home button in nyquist and bodeplot
- [x] Tf^(i) implement
- [ ] Can SLICOT be used to implement some routines and transforms?
